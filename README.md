## I have built this as a learning project. These were my learnings :

* Building an extensive backend API with Node.js & Express
* Protecting routes/endpoints with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* Extensive API testing with Postman
* Integrating React with our backend in an elegant way, creating a great workflow
* Building our frontend to work with the API
* Using Redux for app state management
* Creating reducers and actions for our resources
* Creating many container components that integrate with Redux
* Testing with the Redux Chrome extension
* Creating a build script, securing our keys and deploy to Heroku using Git
